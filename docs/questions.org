* Questions and Open Issues

This file tracks questions that arise during development and their resolutions.

** Active Questions

Questions that need answers before work can proceed.

*** TODO Should we support both PlantUML and GraphViz or choose one?
**** Context
The requirements mention "PlantUML or GraphViz" but don't specify which to prioritize.

**** Impact
Affects implementation scope and testing burden.

**** Discussion
- PlantUML pros: Higher-level syntax, easier for simple diagrams
- GraphViz pros: More control, better for complex graphs, more widely available
- Could implement both and let user choose via configuration

**** Resolution
(To be filled in after decision is made)

*** TODO What should be the minimum Emacs version requirement?
**** Context
Need to determine compatibility target.

**** Impact
Affects which Emacs Lisp features we can use.

**** Discussion
- org-edna requires Emacs 26.1+
- Modern Emacs Lisp features (like threading macros) require 25.1+
- Most users are on 27.1+ now (as of 2025)

**** Resolution
(To be filled in)

*** TODO How should we handle very large dependency graphs?
**** Context
If a user has hundreds of tasks, the graph could be overwhelming.

**** Impact
Affects rendering strategy and user experience.

**** Discussion
Possible approaches:
- Filter by date range (only show tasks due within X days)
- Filter by tag/category
- Filter by depth (only show N levels of dependencies)
- Use interactive/zoomable visualization

**** Resolution
