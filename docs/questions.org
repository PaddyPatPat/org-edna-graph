* Questions and Open Issues

This file tracks questions that arise during development and their resolutions.

** Active Questions

Questions that need answers before work can proceed.

*** TODO What visualization technology should we use?
**** Context
Need to choose between PlantUML, GraphViz, or potentially what org-roam-ui uses. The goal is org-roam-UI level quality that can handle hundreds to thousands of tasks.

**** Impact
This is a foundational decision that affects the entire implementation approach.

**** Discussion
- PlantUML pros: Higher-level syntax, easier for simple diagrams
- PlantUML cons: May not scale well to thousands of nodes
- GraphViz pros: More control, better for complex graphs, widely available
- GraphViz cons: Lower-level, may require more implementation work
- org-roam-UI approach: Unknown, needs research

**** Required Research
1. What does org-roam-UI use for visualization?
2. How do PlantUML and GraphViz perform with 1000+ node graphs?
3. What are the difficulty levels for each implementation?
4. Which approach best supports filtering, zooming, and interaction at scale?
5. Can we achieve org-roam-UI quality level with PlantUML/GraphViz?

**** Resolution
Needs research phase to answer the questions above. This should be priority research task. 


 

** Resolved Questions

Questions that have been answered.

*** DONE Where should documentation live - wiki or main repo?
CLOSED: [2025-11-04]

**** Resolution
Main repository in =/docs= directory. See decisions.org for full rationale.

*** DONE What should be the minimum Emacs version requirement?
CLOSED: [2025-11-04]

**** Resolution
Emacs 26.1+ (matching org-edna's requirement). Documented in decisions.org.

*** DONE What scale of graphs must we support?
CLOSED: [2025-11-04]

**** Resolution
Hundreds to thousands of tasks. This is the primary use case, not an edge case. Added as a critical constraint in constraints.org. This significantly affects choice of visualization technology.

*** TODO Question Title
**** Context
Background information about the question.

**** Impact
Why does this matter? What's blocked by not knowing the answer?

**** Discussion
Pros/cons of different approaches, research findings, opinions.

**** Resolution
Final decision and who made it. Move to "Resolved Questions" when answered.
