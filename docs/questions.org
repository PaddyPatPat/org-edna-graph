* Questions and Open Issues

This file tracks questions that arise during development and their resolutions.

** Active Questions

Questions that need answers before work can proceed.

*** TODO Should we support both PlantUML and GraphViz or choose one?
**** Context
The requirements mention "PlantUML or GraphViz" but don't specify which to prioritize.

**** Impact
Affects implementation scope and testing burden.

**** Discussion
- PlantUML pros: Higher-level syntax, easier for simple diagrams
- GraphViz pros: More control, better for complex graphs, more widely available
- Could implement both and let user choose via configuration

**** Resolution
we should do more research on what is going to be the best outcome for this project. The intention was defined an easy solution to create an initial first diagram and that this would be expected to change later as the project became more mature. The best outcome would be something that looks of the same class of quality as org-roam-UI. at the stage I think the best thing to do is to research how difficult each implementation would be to achieve. Find out what org-roam-ui uses to create its visualisations so thst can be compared against plantUML and graphviz. 

*** TODO What should be the minimum Emacs version requirement?
**** Context
Need to determine compatibility target.

**** Impact
Affects which Emacs Lisp features we can use.

**** Discussion
- org-edna requires Emacs 26.1+
- Modern Emacs Lisp features (like threading macros) require 25.1+
- Most users are on 27.1+ now (as of 2025)

**** Resolution
The minimum Emacs version should match that of org-edna as our package requires this package to operate.

*** TODO How should we handle very large dependency graphs?
**** Context
If a user has hundreds of tasks, the graph could be overwhelming.

**** Impact
Affects rendering strategy and user experience.

**** Discussion
Possible approaches:
- Filter by date range (only show tasks due within X days)
- Filter by tag/category
- Filter by depth (only show N levels of dependencies)
- Use interactive/zoomable visualization

**** Resolution
There will definitely be hundreds, id not thousands of tasks to graph. This probably forms a constraint for what visualisation methods can handle this kind of request. 

** Resolved Questions

Questions that have been answered.

*** DONE Where should documentation live - wiki or main repo?
CLOSED: [2025-11-04]

**** Resolution
Main repository in =/docs= directory. See decisions.org for full rationale.

** Question Template

Copy this for new questions:

*** TODO Question Title
**** Context
Background information about the question.

**** Impact
Why does this matter? What's blocked by not knowing the answer?

**** Discussion
Pros/cons of different approaches, research findings, opinions.

**** Resolution
Final decision and who made it. Move to "Resolved Questions" when answered.
