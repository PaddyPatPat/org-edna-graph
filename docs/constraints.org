* org-edna dependency compatibility.

Org-depend is the other option for defining dependencies between tasks however it only allows to set TODO keywords and has no functionality to control scheduled dates or other advanced stuff.

Org-edna is a more capable version of org-depend for defining dependencies.

* Minimum Emacs version: 26.1+

The package must be compatible with Emacs 26.1 or later, matching the requirement of org-edna.

* Must handle large-scale graphs.

The visualization system must be able to handle hundreds to thousands of tasks. This is not an edge case but a primary use case. The chosen visualization technology must:
- Render large graphs efficiently
- Remain responsive with thousands of nodes
- Provide meaningful visualization even at scale (filtering, zooming, clustering, etc.)
- Not become unusable or overwhelming with large datasets

This constraint significantly affects the choice of visualization technology and implementation approach.
