** Things that are missing.

*** There doesn't appear to be any automation for creating the PlantUML file.
Karl appears to create the PlantUML file manually from his org-mode files and then converts that into an image.

Sacha uses GraphViz in order to create a diagram of the related tasks and outcomes.

** Things that are missing.
*** It doesn't appear to use org-edna dependency syntax.
This means that you can't make the most of org-edna's functions.
*** It doesn't appear to pull it's tasks from multiple files.

* Similar in intention to what [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui][org-roam-ui]] provides but for tasks.
Org-roam-ui is way too slick, and way too polished for what I'm currently imagining is possible.

However, it demonstrates what can be achieved to visually display relationships between things spread across multiple files.
