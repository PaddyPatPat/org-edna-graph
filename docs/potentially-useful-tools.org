An Emacs package for creating a PlantUML file from existing org-edna dependencies.
** Things that are missing.
*** There is no interactive defun within this package.
It requires another function to call it.
*** Multi-file support exists but isn't obvious.
The code does support multiple files via =org-agenda-files= variable (see Query Source below), but this capability isn't well documented or exposed through a user-friendly interface.

** The code performs the following tasks.

*** Query Structure:
Two queries are defined: one for blocked nodes and one for blocked nodes with IDs.
*** Query Fields:
Each query selects a link to the node and a link to the blocking node.
*** Query Source:
Both queries search all files in the org-agenda-files variable.
*** Task Query:
Retrieve tasks with the “:BLOCKER:” tag and extract the “ids” property.
*** Graph Skin:
Define the “usecase” skin parameter with background color mappings from org-graph-edna-node-properties.
*** Color Association:
Create a list of color associations for tasks, mapping task names to colors.
