* Architectural Decisions for org-edna-graph

This file records all major architectural decisions made during development.

** Format
Each decision should follow this structure:
- Date

- Context/Problem
- Decision
- Rationale
- Consequences

** Decision Log

*** [2025-11-04] Documentation moved from wiki to main repository
**** Decision maker
Claude (initial exploration session)

**** Context/Problem
GitHub wiki is a separate repository requiring separate authorization. This complicated pushing changes and keeping documentation synchronized.

**** Decision
Move all documentation from wiki to =/docs= directory in main repository.

**** Rationale
- Keeps documentation version-controlled with code
- Easier to maintain consistency
- Simpler git workflow
- Better Emacs org-mode integration
- All in one place for contributors

**** Consequences
- Need to delete wiki after confirming documentation is complete
- Documentation links updated to use file: protocol
- Images remain in /images at repo root

*** [2025-11-04] Minimum Emacs version requirement
**** Decision maker
Patrick Duncan (project owner)

**** Context/Problem
Need to determine compatibility target for the package to know which Emacs Lisp features we can use.

**** Decision
Minimum Emacs version should be 26.1+ (matching org-edna's requirement).

**** Rationale
Since our package requires org-edna to operate, it makes sense to match their minimum version requirement. org-edna requires Emacs 26.1+.

**** Consequences
- Can use modern Emacs Lisp features available in 26.1+
- Simplifies dependency management
- Clear compatibility story for users

** Decision Template

Copy this template for new decisions:

*** [YYYY-MM-DD] Decision Title

Name or agent identifier

**** Context/Problem
What problem are we solving? What's the situation?

**** Decision
What did we decide to do?

**** Rationale
Why did we choose this approach?

**** Consequences
What are the implications of this decision? Trade-offs?
