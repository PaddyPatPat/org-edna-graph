*** [2025-11-04] Documentation moved from wiki to main repository
**** Decision maker
Claude (initial exploration session)

**** Context/Problem
GitHub wiki is a separate repository requiring separate authorization. This complicated pushing changes and keeping documentation synchronized.

**** Decision
Move all documentation from wiki to =/docs= directory in main repository.

**** Rationale
- Keeps documentation version-controlled with code
- Easier to maintain consistency
- Simpler git workflow
- Better Emacs org-mode integration
- All in one place for contributors

**** Consequences
- Need to delete wiki after confirming documentation is complete
- Documentation links updated to use file: protocol
- Images remain in /images at repo root
