* Parallel Development Strategy for org-edna-graph

This document outlines how work on this project can be parallelized across multiple Claude agents/sessions, and defines specialized repository agents for efficient development.

** Specialized Repository Agents

These agents should be created to provide deep expertise on related repositories:

*** Agent: org-edna-expert
**** Purpose
Deep understanding of the org-edna package - its API, data structures, and functionality.

**** Repository
https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/org-edna-el/ or https://sr.ht/~bzg/org-edna/

**** Key Questions This Agent Should Answer
- How does org-edna store dependency information?
- What are the BLOCKER and TRIGGER property formats?
- How does org-edna parse and evaluate conditions?
- What functions/APIs are available for querying dependencies?
- How does org-edna handle scheduled dates and timestamps?
- What is the internal data structure for dependency graphs?

**** Deliverable
A comprehensive document: =docs/org-edna-api-reference.org= containing:
- API function reference
- Data structure documentation
- Property format specifications
- Example usage patterns
- Integration points for our package

*** Agent: lytex-org-graph-edna-expert
**** Purpose
Deep understanding of the lytex/org-graph-edna implementation approach.

**** Repository

** Recommended Execution Plan

*** Phase 1: Research (Fully Parallel)
Launch 3 specialized agents simultaneously:
1. org-edna-expert → Task A1
2. lytex-org-graph-edna-expert → Task A2
3. plantuml-graphviz-expert → Task A3

Expected Duration: 1-2 sessions each

*** Phase 2: Design (Partially Parallel)
Launch 2 agents:
1. Architecture agent → Tasks B1, B2
2. General agent → Task D1 (examples)

Expected Duration: 1 session each

*** Phase 3: Implementation (Highly Parallel)
Launch 4-6 agents simultaneously:
1. Parser specialist → Task C1
2. Graph builder specialist → Task C2
3. PlantUML specialist → Task C3
4. GraphViz specialist → Task C4
5. Renderer specialist → Task C5
6. Interface specialist → Task C6

Expected Duration: 2-3 sessions each

*** Phase 4: Integration & Polish (Sequential)
1. Integration agent → Combine all modules
2. Testing agent → Task D3
3. Documentation agent → Task D4

Expected Duration: 2-3 sessions total

** Agent Communication

Since Claude agents can't directly communicate, use this repository's documentation:

*** Shared Information Files
- =docs/decisions.org= - Record all architectural decisions
- =docs/api-contracts.org= - Define interfaces between modules
- =docs/progress.org= - Track completion status of all tasks
- =docs/questions.org= - Log questions that need answering

*** Workflow
1. Each agent reads relevant docs before starting
2. Each agent updates progress.org when completing work
3. Each agent logs decisions in decisions.org
4. Each agent logs questions in questions.org
5. Next agent reviews these files before continuing

** Estimated Timeline

- Phase 1 (Research): 1-2 days with parallel agents
- Phase 2 (Design): 1 day
- Phase 3 (Implementation): 3-5 days with parallel agents
- Phase 4 (Polish): 1-2 days

Total: ~1-2 weeks with aggressive parallelization vs. 3-4 weeks sequential.

** Success Criteria

- All specialized agents complete their deliverables
- Architecture is documented and agreed upon
- All implementation modules pass tests
- Package installs cleanly via straight.el
- Interactive function generates diagrams successfully
- Documentation is complete and clear
