* org-edna-graph
Visually displaying org-edna dependencies between org-mode tasks.

** The role of this package.
Create a package that allows for dependencies between org-mode tasks, defined by org-edna, to be displayed in an image. This image might use PlantUML or GraphViz for example.

The image would be updated whenever an interactive function was called.

The source of the org-mode tasks could be either a single file, or multiple files. Multiple files could be those used by org-agenda for example.

This repository contains an Emacs lisp  function for creating a PlantUML file from existing org-edna dependencies.
**** Things that are missing.
***** There is no interactive defun within this package.
It requires another function to call it.
***** Can it gather from multiple files?
Or is it restricted to only looking at one file at a time?

Karl appears to create the PlantUML file manually from his org-mode files and then converts that into an image.

**** Things that are missing.

***** There doesn't appear to be any automation for creating the PlantUML file.

This uses GraphViz in order to create a diagram of the related tasks and outcomes.

**** Things that are missing.
***** It doesn't appear to use org-edna dependency syntax.
This means that you can't make the most of org-edna's functions.
